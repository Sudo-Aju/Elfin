# Overview

**Zhi Fu Bao (支付宝)** is an autonomous customer-assistance robot designed to improve shopping experiences by combining mobile robotics, facial recognition, and digital payment systems.

The robot follows customers around a store, recognizes them using facial recognition, and provides a personalized experience by calling customers by their name.

After customers complete their shopping, Zhi Fu Bao displays their **Alipay QR payment code**, allowing them to complete transactions quickly without waiting at traditional checkout counters.

The robot is built on a wheeled platform with obstacle avoidance capabilities, allowing it to navigate indoor environments while safely following customers.

Key hardware includes:

- Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040 Microcontroller
- DRV8833 Motor Driver
- LM2596 Buck Converter
- 7.9V Series Battery Pack
- Ultrasonic Sensors
- Camera Module for Facial Recognition
- Display Module for QR Payment

The project explores autonomous navigation, embedded systems, human-computer interaction, and smart retail automation.

# Motivation

Traditional shopping experiences often require customers to wait in queues and manually complete payment processes.

Zhi Fu Bao was designed around a simple idea:

> How can robotics make everyday shopping faster and more interactive?

The goal was to create a mobile assistant capable of:

- Following customers autonomously
- Providing personalized interaction
- Reducing checkout time
- Combining robotics with digital payment systems

Inspired by:

- Autonomous robots
- Smart retail systems
- Embedded electronics
- Human-machine interaction
- Modern payment technology

The result is a robotic assistant that combines mobility, recognition, and payment into a single platform.
